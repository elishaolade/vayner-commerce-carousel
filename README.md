# Vayner Commerce Carousel

Working solution to assessment.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Process
I focused getting functionality down as close to the requirements as possible. Then I built a rough setup of the carousel.
The method was to build out the code, and modularize after the main functionality was built.
